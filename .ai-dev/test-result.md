## Executable verification: revise retry stop reason preservation

- Verification target: scripts/ai-dev-auto-cycle-full.ps1
- Goal: AI Dev Loop revise 재시도 중단 사유 보존 보강

### Scenario 1: DryRun no-mutation
- Result: PASS_DRYRUN_NO_MUTATION
- Before dirty count: 13
- After dirty count: 13
- Interpretation: DryRun must not run Codex/check/review/commit/complete-task as mutating steps and must not change git status.

### Scenario 2: revise repeat stop reason preservation
- Result: PASS_REVISE_STOP_REASON_PRESERVED
- Checks:
  - PASS: decision revise branch exists
  - PASS: lastReviewDecision is recorded
  - PASS: severity is included
  - PASS: next_step is included
  - PASS: review summary is included
- Interpretation: when re-review remains decision revise, the script must preserve latest summary, severity, next_step, and lastReviewDecision.
